## Application installer formats

Tauri generates two files when compiling for Android: APK and AAB. APK is a file that can be used to install the application on your phone, and AAB is a file that can be uploaded to the Play Store to generate optimized APKs for users based on their devices.


## Signing

To upload an application, you need to sign your application. This is a security measure, in order to confirm that a new version of an application was uploaded by the author.


The default option uses Google to manage and store the key. This can be changed before updating a new version. The easiest way is on `internal testing`, create a new release, create a new track and click on `change signing key`.

  <TabItem label="Java key store">

    This option is self managed, meaning you have to save the signing file, be careful not to loose it or make it accesible to others.

    1.  After clicking on `change signing key`, select the option `Export and upload a key from Java keystore`.

    2.  Download, from the links available in that option, the encryption public key and the PEPK tool.

    2.  Create a new keystore:

    ```bash ins={4}
    keytool -genkey -v -keystore myKeyStore.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias myAlias
    ```

    3. Create the file that indicates Google what is your signature

    ```bash ins={4}
    java -jar pepk.jar --keystore=myKeyStore.jks --alias=myAlias --output=output.zip \
        --include-cert --rsa-aes-encryption --encryption-key-path=./encryption_public_key.pem
    ```

    4. Upload the generated file (`output.zip`) to Google on the link that says `Upload generated ZIP`

    5. Sign the AAB file:

    ```bash
    jarsigner -verbose -sigalg SHA256withRSA -digestalg SHA-256 -keystore myKeyStore.jks \
      ./src-tauri/gen/android/app/build/outputs/bundle/universalRelease/app-universal-release.aab myAlias
    ```

    The AAB file generated by Tauri is now signed, you can upload it to the Google Play Console as an App Bundle.
